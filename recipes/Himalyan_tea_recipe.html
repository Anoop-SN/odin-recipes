    <h4>Description</h4>
    Himalayan chai is a type of masala chai made with tea leaves 
    and spices sourced from the Himalayan region of India. 
    The region's unique soil and high elevation create distinct 
    tea leaves, which are then combined with traditional Indian 
    spices for a flavorful, aromatic, and often strong cup of tea.
