    <h4>Description</h4>
    Green tea is made from the leaves and buds of the Camellia
     sinensis plant. Originating in China, it is produced by 
     steaming or pan-frying the leaves to prevent oxidation, 
     which distinguishes it from black or oolong tea. 
     The processing methods and growing conditions vary widely, 
     creating numerous types of green tea with distinct 
     flavors and aromas.
